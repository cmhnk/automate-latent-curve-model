# automate-latent-curve-model

Simulates multi center randomized control trial data, then fits
multiple group latent curve models to each center (with groups being
either tx or control) using lavaan. Finally, outputs model parameters
to a Wordsmith-ready format so that reports can be generated for each
center.
